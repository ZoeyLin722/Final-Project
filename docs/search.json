    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe availability and quality of housing are critical indicators of a city’s livability and sustainability. As one of the largest and fastest-growing cities in Canada, Toronto faces significant challenges in maintaining affordable, safe, and high-quality housing for its residents.\nThe Apartment Building Evaluation database, provided by the City of Toronto, serves as a valuable resource for analyzing the quality of housing across the city. This dataset contains useful information, including the physical condition of buildings, availability of amenities, compliance with municipal standards, and management practices. These data points enable a comprehensive assessment of the factors that contribute to the evaluation scores of apartment buildings.\nWe chose this topic because housing is a fundamental human need, and understanding the quality of Toronto’s apartment buildings can shed light on broader issues related to urban living, social equity, and public policy. This analysis is particularly relevant given the rising concerns over housing affordability and safety in urban centers globally.\nThe questions we are interested in studying include:\nWhat patterns emerge in apartment building evaluations across Toronto?\nAre there geographical disparities in building quality within the city?\nWhat factors correlate most strongly with higher or lower evaluation scores?"

    "text": "2.1 Description\nThis dataset is available from the City of Toronto’s Open Data Portal, which comprises 3,571 entries and 71 columns. It is created for evaluations of apartment buildings across Toronto, assessing various quality and compliance metrics. The data is publicly accessible through the City of Toronto’s Open Data Portal.\nThe dataset is available in CSV format, which is easy to download and apply in R studio. Each row represents an individual apartment building evaluation, with columns detailing attributes such as building address, evaluation scores, compliance status, and inspection dates. The dataset is updated by the end of every year.\nThe dataset includes multiple columns capturing various aspects of apartment building evaluations. The number of rows corresponds to the total number of evaluated buildings, which may vary with each update. Key columns include:\n\nYear Built: The year when the apartment was built.\nEvaluation Score: A numerical score representing the building’s quality assessment.\nWardname: The particular area where the apartment is located.\nProperty Type: The particular type of the apartment (private, social housing, Toronto community Housing Corporation).\n\nThe dataset contains a lot of missing values for variables including “FENCING”, “RETAINING WALLS”, “CATCH BASINS / STORM DRAINAGE”, “CLOTHING DROP BOXES”, “ACCESSORY BUILDINGS”, and so on. These variables might be deleted if missing values are dominant.\nTo import the dataset into R for analysis, first download the CSV file from the website, then use the read.csv() function to load the data.\nThe dataset is available on the City of Toronto’s Open Data Portal: [https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/apartment-building-evaluation/]\n\n\nCode\nbuilding &lt;- read.csv(\"/Users/ruobingzhang/Documents/==/columbia/sem1/stat5702EDA/EDAfinal2/Apartment Building Evaluations 2023 - current.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nCode\nshape &lt;- dim(building)\ncat(\"The dataset has\", shape[1], \"rows and\", shape[2], \"columns.\\n\")\n\n\nThe dataset has 3571 rows and 71 columns."

    "text": "3.1 Housing Quality and Regional Disparities in Toronto\nStudying the relationship between housing quality and regional differences is crucial for both prospective residents and investors in Toronto. To represent housing quality, we utilized the Current Building Evaluation Scores from our dataset. By visualizing these scores with a density plot, we can observe their distribution across the city.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(building, aes(x = `CURRENT BUILDING EVAL SCORE`)) +\n  geom_histogram(\n    aes(y = after_stat(density)),\n    binwidth = 3,\n    fill = \"skyblue\",\n    color = \"white\",\n    alpha = 0.8\n  ) +\n  geom_density(\n    color = \"darkred\",\n    linewidth = 1.2,\n    linetype = \"dashed\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Distribution of Current Building Evaluation Scores\",\n    subtitle = \"Histogram with density overlay\",\n    x = \"Current Condo Evaluation Scores\",\n    y = \"Density\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 12, face = \"italic\", hjust = 0.5),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this histogram, we observed that the distribution appears to be left-skewed, with the majority of condo evaluation scores concentrated on the higher end (around 75–100). This indicates that most buildings in Toronto have relatively high evaluation scores, with fewer buildings falling in the lower quality range. To further investigate the evaluation scores in specific regions, we divided the city using Toronto’s 25-ward system and visualized the distribution of different property types within each ward using a Cleveland dot plot.\n\n\nCode\ncleveland_data &lt;- building |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(`CURRENT BUILDING EVAL SCORE`), !is.na(WARDNAME), !is.na(PROPERTYTYPE))\n\nward_scores &lt;- cleveland_data |&gt;\n  group_by(WARDNAME, PROPERTYTYPE) |&gt;\n  summarise(AverageScore = mean(`CURRENT BUILDING EVAL SCORE`, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  arrange(AverageScore)\n\nggplot(ward_scores, aes(x = AverageScore, y = reorder(WARDNAME, AverageScore), color = PROPERTYTYPE)) +\n  geom_point(linewidth = 3, alpha = 0.6) + \n  geom_segment(aes(x = min(AverageScore), xend = AverageScore, \n                   y = reorder(WARDNAME, AverageScore), \n                   yend = reorder(WARDNAME, AverageScore)),\n               color = \"grey70\", size = 0.5) + \n  labs(\n    title = \"Cleveland Dot Plot of Evaluation Scores\",\n    subtitle = \"Comparison of average scores across wards, colored by property type\",\n    x = \"Average Current Building Evaluation Score\",\n    y = \"Ward Name\",\n    color = \"Property Type\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\", size = 18, color = \"#333333\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 14, color = \"#666666\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, color = \"#333333\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12, color = \"#333333\"),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\", color = \"#333333\"),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\", color = \"#333333\"),\n    panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color = \"grey90\"),\n    panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),\n    panel.grid.major.y = element_blank()\n  ) +\n  scale_color_viridis_d() \n\n\n\n\n\nBased on this Cleveland dot plot, Social Housing and TCHC properties exhibit significant variance in evaluation scores, while Private Housing tends to have more consistent scores, generally concentrated in the higher range. Notably, Social Housing in the Scarborough and Etobicoke Centre wards stands out with exceptionally high scores, exceeding 95, which could be attributed to recent investments in renovation and maintenance or newer construction in these areas. On the other hand, wards like Davenport, Beaches-East York, and Humber River-Black Creek have the lowest overall evaluation scores. This may reflect aging infrastructure, limited funding for maintenance, or a higher concentration of older properties, particularly in social housing categories.\n\n\nCode\nfiltered_data &lt;- building |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(WARDNAME) & !is.na(`CURRENT BUILDING EVAL SCORE`))\n\nfiltered_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(WARDNAME) %&gt;%\n  mutate(MedianScore = median(`CURRENT BUILDING EVAL SCORE`, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;%\n  ungroup() %&gt;%\n  mutate(WARDNAME = reorder(WARDNAME, MedianScore))\n\nsuppressMessages({\nggplot(data = filtered_data, aes(\n  x = `CURRENT BUILDING EVAL SCORE`,\n  y = WARDNAME,\n  fill = WARDNAME\n)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(scale = 2, alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    limits = c(40, NA), \n    expand = c(0, 0)\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Ridgeline Plot of Current Eval Scores\",\n    x = \"Current Building Evaluation Score\",\n    y = \"Ward Name\",\n    fill = \"Ward\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, angle = 0),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.position = \"none\"\n  )\n})\n\n\nPicking joint bandwidth of 2.49\n\n\n\n\n\nThis ridgeline plot shows a different ranking of evaluation scores based on ward than the previous Cleveland dot plot, as the former one used raw scores whereas the latter one used mean scores. Some wards show a wider spread of scores (e.g., Scarborough Guildwood, Davenport), suggesting greater variability in housing quality within those areas. Wards like Willowdale and Scarborough North appear to have relatively higher median evaluation scores, as seen by the placement of their peaks.\n\n\nCode\nmedian_val &lt;- median(building$`CURRENT BUILDING EVAL SCORE`, na.rm = TRUE)\niqr_val &lt;- IQR(building$`CURRENT BUILDING EVAL SCORE`, na.rm = TRUE)\nbuilding$robust_scaled_score &lt;- (building$`CURRENT BUILDING EVAL SCORE` - median_val) / iqr_val\n\nbuilding$robust_scaled_score &lt;- (building$`CURRENT BUILDING EVAL SCORE` - median_val) / iqr_val\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Define a threshold for low scores (e.g., below the first quartile)\nlow_threshold &lt;- quantile(building$`CURRENT BUILDING EVAL SCORE`, 0.005, na.rm = TRUE)\n\n# Add a new column to classify points\nbuilding$score_category &lt;- ifelse(building$`CURRENT BUILDING EVAL SCORE` &lt; low_threshold, \"Low\", \"Others\")\n\n# Plot with highlighted low scores and region labels\nggplot(building, aes(x = X, y = Y)) +\n  # General points\n  geom_point(aes(color = `CURRENT BUILDING EVAL SCORE`), size = 2, alpha = 0.6) +\n  # Highlight low scores\n  geom_point(data = subset(building, score_category == \"Low\"),\n             aes(x = X, y = Y), color = \"blue\", size = 3, shape = 4) +\n  # Add region labels for low scores\n  geom_text(data = subset(building, score_category == \"Low\"),\n            aes(x = X, y = Y, label = WARDNAME),  # Replace 'WARDNAME' with the actual column name for region\n            size = 3, hjust = -0.2, color = \"black\") +\n  # Color gradient for scores\n  scale_color_gradient(low = \"red\", high = \"green\") +\n  # Labels and themes\n  labs(\n    title = \"Building Evaluation Scores by Location\",\n    x = \"X Coordinate\",\n    y = \"Y Coordinate\",\n    color = \"Score\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot reveals that low-scoring apartments, marked with blue crosses, are often located near the city center or in historically older neighborhoods, such as Parkdale-High Park and Spadina-Fort York. In contrast, high-scoring apartments, represented by green dots, cluster in areas like Scarborough Centre and Don Valley North, which likely benefit from newer constructions, better maintenance, and stronger urban planning. These observations highlight significant regional disparities in building quality, potentially influenced by factors like economic conditions and property types. Next, we will explore the relationship between scores and building ageto understand whether older buildings tend to have lower evaluations."

By visualizing these trends, we aim to uncover patterns that could inform future housing policies and urban development strategies.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(building, aes(x = `YEAR BUILT`, y = `CURRENT BUILDING EVAL SCORE`)) +\n  stat_bin2d(\n    bins = 50,              \n    aes(fill = ..count..)\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_gradientn(\n    colors = viridis::turbo(10), \n    name = \"Building Count\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Building Evaluation Scores by Year Built\",\n    subtitle = \"Density of Buildings Evaluated Across Different Years\",\n    x = \"Year Built\",\n    y = \"Building Evaluation Score\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 16) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(\n      size = 22, face = \"bold\", hjust = 0.5, color = \"#333333\"\n    ),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(\n      size = 16, hjust = 0.5, color = \"#555555\"\n    ),\n    axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 12, color = \"#333333\"),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = 12, face = \"bold\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 10),\n    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = \"gray85\", linewidth = 0.5),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heatmap shows that most buildings are built a bit after 1950 as the red center is positioned at around 1960. Overall, the majority of buildings were constructed between 1950 and 2000, whereas buildings constructed before 1900 are sparse. There are still a few buildings plotted after 2000, possibly because of limited data availability or fewer constructions. In terms of evaluation scores, buildings constructed between 1950 and 2000 generally show a higher density of scores clustering around the 75-100 range, indicating better overall quality or maintenance. Conversely, buildings constructed before 1900 tend to have more dispersed and lower scores, reflecting potential issues with aging infrastructure and upkeep. Buildings built after 2000 exhibit high evaluation scores, although their count is relatively low.\n\n\nCode\nbuilding$YearGroup &lt;- cut(\n  building$`YEAR BUILT`,\n  breaks = quantile(building$`YEAR BUILT`, probs = c(0, 1/3, 2/3, 1), na.rm = TRUE),\n  labels = c(\"Early Period\", \"Mid Period\", \"Recent Period\"),\n  include.lowest = TRUE\n)\n\nallu_data &lt;- building |&gt;\n  group_by(YearGroup, PROPERTYTYPE) |&gt;\n  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\nggplot(data = allu_data,\n       aes(x = YearGroup, stratum = PROPERTYTYPE, alluvium = PROPERTYTYPE, y = Count)) +\n  geom_flow(aes(fill = PROPERTYTYPE), curve_type = \"sigmoid\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  geom_stratum(width = 1/8, fill = \"grey\", color = \"black\") +\n  geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", aes(label = after_stat(stratum)), \n            size = 2, color = \"black\", vjust = 0.5) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_d(option = \"plasma\", name = \"Property Type\") +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year Built Group\",\n    y = \"Count of Properties\",\n    title = \"Alluvial Diagram of Property Types by Year Built Group\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n  theme(\n  plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n  axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12, angle = 30, hjust = 1), \n  axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),\n  axis.title = element_text(size = 14),\n  legend.position = \"right\",\n  legend.title = element_text(size = 12),\n  legend.text = element_text(size = 10)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe alluvial diagram splits the year built into three equal groups, we can observe that across all periods, private properties are the most prevalent property type. But as recent period approaches, the proportions of social housing and TCHC (Toronto Community Housing Corporation) have increased a lot, despite that private housing still dominates.\n\n\nCode\nbuilding &lt;- building |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    old_or_new = ifelse(`YEAR BUILT` &gt; 1960, \"new\", \"old\"),\n    high_or_low = ifelse(\n      `CURRENT BUILDING EVAL SCORE` &gt;= mean(`CURRENT BUILDING EVAL SCORE`, na.rm = TRUE),\n      \"high\", \"low\"\n    )\n  )\n\nmosaic(\n  ~ high_or_low + old_or_new + PROPERTYTYPE, \n  data = building,\n  highlighting = \"PROPERTYTYPE\",\n  highlighting_fill = c(\"#ADD8E6\", \"#4682B4\", \"#00008B\"),  \n  direction = c(\"v\", \"v\", \"h\"),  \n  main = \"Mosaic Plot of Building Characteristics\",\n  sub = \"Split by Evaluation Score, Year Built, and Property Type\",\n  labeling_args = list(\n    gp_labels = gpar(fontsize = c(10, 8, 6), fontface = \"bold\"),  \n    gp_varnames = gpar(fontsize = 10, fontface = \"bold\", col = \"darkblue\"),  \n    rot_labels = c(0, 0, 45),  \n    just_labels = c(\"center\", \"center\", \"center\")  \n  ),\n  keep_aspect_ratio = FALSE,  \n  margins = unit(c(2, 2, 2, 4), \"lines\")  \n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mosaic plot further complements the findings from the heatmap and alluvial diagram, revealing that private buildings are the dominant property type across all time periods. However, their proportion has decreased over time, as new buildings have seen a relatively higher representation of non-private property types such as social housing and TCHC. This shift suggests a gradual diversification of property types in Toronto’s housing landscape.\nIn terms of evaluation scores, the mosaic plot highlights an interesting pattern: older buildings tend to have both high and low evaluation scores, indicating greater variability in their condition. This aligns with the heatmap, which shows a more dispersed distribution of scores for older buildings, likely due to aging infrastructure and inconsistent maintenance practices. In contrast, newer buildings exhibit a tighter range of scores, with a notable concentration in the higher evaluation categories, as seen in the heatmap’s red and green clusters around the 75–100 range."

In contrast, older buildings generally have lower scores, often attributed to outdated structures and less favorable maintenance conditions. Medium-aged buildings display more variability in certain attributes, such as the number of storeys, which might influence their evaluation scores. These findings highlight the importance of maintenance and modernization in improving building evaluations across different age groups.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(building, aes(x = `STAIRWELL LIGHTING`, y = `CURRENT BUILDING EVAL SCORE`)) + \n  geom_jitter(aes(color = `BUILDING CLEANLINESS`), alpha = 0.6, size = 2) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Impact of Stairwell Lighting and Cleanliness on Evaluation Score\",\n    x = \"Stairwell Lighting Score\",\n    y = \"Building Evaluation Score\",\n    color = \"Building Cleanliness\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe scatterplot reveals the combined impact of stairwell lighting and building cleanliness on evaluation scores. Higher stairwell lighting scores (2 and 3) are generally associated with higher building evaluation scores, clustering around the 75–100 range. This trend is further emphasized by the color gradient representing building cleanliness: buildings with higher cleanliness levels (darker blue) tend to achieve higher evaluation scores, even when stairwell lighting scores are moderate. Conversely, buildings with lower cleanliness levels (lighter blue) are more widely dispersed and more likely to have lower evaluation scores, regardless of their stairwell lighting scores. This suggests that while both factors are important, building cleanliness plays a critical role in achieving higher evaluation scores."

However, some regions display clusters of lower-quality housing, particularly in social housing and TCHC properties, which tend to score lower than private properties. Regional variability is evident, with certain wards (e.g. Willowdale, Toronto-Danforth, etc.) consistently scoring higher than others, reflecting disparities in housing conditions across the city.\nOver time, private housing has remained the dominant property type, but newer developments show a growing presence of social housing and TCHC properties, highlighting shifts in urban development priorities.

These findings emphasize the importance of maintenance and infrastructure improvements in enhancing housing quality and provide valuable guidance for policymakers to address regional disparities and prioritize upgrades in lower-performing areas.\nAnalysis also shows that factors such as the year of construction, building cleanliness, and stairwell lighting influence evaluation scores. Modern, well-maintained, and better-lit buildings tend to score higher."

    "text": "The main takeaway from our analysis is that housing quality in Toronto, as measured by evaluation scores, exhibits significant regional and temporal disparities influenced by property type, maintenance, and infrastructure. Low-scoring apartments are often concentrated in older neighborhoods and social housing areas, while high-scoring apartments cluster in newer developments with better maintenance and planning. Over time, private housing has remained the dominant property type, but newer developments show a gradual diversification toward social housing and TCHC properties. Older buildings display greater variability in evaluation scores, reflecting challenges with aging infrastructure and inconsistent maintenance. Factors like the year of construction, building cleanliness, and stairwell lighting play a critical role in determining evaluation scores, highlighting the importance of modernization and upkeep in improving housing quality.\nHowever, our analysis is limited by the constraints of the dataset. For instance, the lack of a geojson file restricts our ability to thoroughly analyze the relationship between geographic location and apartment quality. Additionally, the dataset suffers from issues with completeness, including missing and duplicated data, which can obscure certain patterns and reduce the reliability of our findings.\nFuture studies could explore the socioeconomic factors driving regional disparities, such as income levels, funding allocations, and community engagement.\nThrough this research, we gained hands-on experience applying the techniques we discussed this semester, such as combining spatial, temporal, and categorical data to uncover patterns in a real-world dataset. We also explored and compared the characteristics of various visualization methods, learning how different types of plots can highlight unique aspects of the data. Additionally, we discovered that identifying the most apparent trends often requires experimenting with different visualization techniques, including faceting and grouping, to reveal meaningful insights effectively."
