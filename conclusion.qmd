# Conclusion

The main takeaway from our analysis is that housing quality in Toronto, as measured by evaluation scores, exhibits significant regional and temporal disparities influenced by property type, maintenance, and infrastructure. Low-scoring apartments are often concentrated in older neighborhoods and social housing areas, while high-scoring apartments cluster in newer developments with better maintenance and planning. Over time, private housing has remained the dominant property type, but newer developments show a gradual diversification toward social housing and TCHC properties. Older buildings display greater variability in evaluation scores, reflecting challenges with aging infrastructure and inconsistent maintenance. Factors like the year of construction, building cleanliness, and stairwell lighting play a critical role in determining evaluation scores, highlighting the importance of modernization and upkeep in improving housing quality.

However, our analysis is limited by the constraints of the dataset. For instance, the lack of a geojson file restricts our ability to thoroughly analyze the relationship between geographic location and apartment quality. Additionally, the dataset suffers from issues with completeness, including missing and duplicated data, which can obscure certain patterns and reduce the reliability of our findings.

Future studies could explore the socioeconomic factors driving regional disparities, such as income levels, funding allocations, and community engagement.

Through this research, we gained hands-on experience applying the techniques we discussed this semester, such as combining spatial, temporal, and categorical data to uncover patterns in a real-world dataset. We also explored and compared the characteristics of various visualization methods, learning how different types of plots can highlight unique aspects of the data. Additionally, we discovered that identifying the most apparent trends often requires experimenting with different visualization techniques, including faceting and grouping, to reveal meaningful insights effectively.
